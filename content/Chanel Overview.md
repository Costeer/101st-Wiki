the channel with your squad name (here deceptive-harlequins) is a channel where only the members of your own squad can see your messages

the platoon hub is only for members of your platoon and the company hub is for members of your company

the company order channel is for small announcements that concern mostly just your company

the company structure channel is used to display the company structure
